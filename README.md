# Brazilian Banking Sector Valuation — Excess Return Model

This project applies the Excess Return (Residual Income) valuation framework to analyze value creation in major Brazilian banks:

- Itaú Unibanco
- Bradesco
- Banco do Brasil
- Santander Brasil

## Motivation

Banks exhibit characteristics that make traditional DCF models less suitable, such as:
- Debt as an operating input
- Regulatory capital requirements
- Implicit reinvestment dynamics

Therefore, ROE versus cost of equity is a widely used valuation approach for financial institutions.

## Methodology

- ROE computed from official financial statements (CVM)
- Cost of equity estimated via CAPM
- Risk-free rate based on SELIC
- Market return based on IBOV
- Analysis period: 2005–2024

## Results

The project analyzes:
- Historical ROE
- Cost of equity
- Economic spread (ROE − Ke)
- Cross-bank and time-series comparisons

## Important Notes

- This project does not estimate fair value or target price
- The focus is on economic value creation
- Academic and educational purpose

## Next Steps

- Estimate intrinsic value using residual income growth models
- Analyze ROE persistence
- Incorporate macroeconomic scenarios
